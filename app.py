# NEDA-aligned MAUT benefit scoring
#
# Reference: Jenkins & Baurzhan (2021), "Guidelines on Project Development and
# Evaluation", prepared for NEDA Philippines.
#
#   - Table A4-13 (Annex 4) catalogues sector-specific economic benefits:
#     Infrastructure/roads generate VOC savings + time savings (most directly
#     quantifiable per A4.1); Healthcare generates avoided morbidity costs and
#     consumer surplus from improved service (A4-13, "Hospital upgrading");
#     Education generates increased lifetime earnings, ~8.6% return in the
#     Philippines (A4.3.2); Social welfare/community development generates
#     time savings (opportunity cost of time) and livelihood income (A4-13).
#
#   - Chapter 2 frames project identification around "gaps in the economy"
#     (basic infrastructure -> food/agriculture -> social sectors such as
#     health and education), which informs both sector prioritisation and
#     the urgency/gap-filling criterion below.
#
#   - A4.4.2 (cost-utility analysis) defines a weighted-sum utility
#     U = sum(w_i * B_i), which is the same MAUT structure used here:
#     each project gets a composite score from 4 weighted criteria.
#
# Criteria (each in [0,1], aggregated to a 1-10 scale):
#
#   C1 - Economic Contribution Potential   weight = 0.40
#        Reflects how directly Table A4-13 benefits can be quantified for
#        the sector (Infrastructure VOC/time savings > Healthcare avoided
#        morbidity > Education lifetime earnings > Social Services time
#        savings/livelihood > Public Safety > Environment > Gen. Government).
#
#   C2 - Social / Human Development Impact weight = 0.35
#        Reflects Chapter 2's prioritisation of health and education as
#        "social sectors" for socio-economic well-being, and Annex 4.4's
#        DALY/QALY-style non-market benefits (Healthcare > Education >
#        Social Services > Public Safety > Environment > Infrastructure >
#        Gen. Government).
#
#   C3 - Implementation Feasibility / Value-for-Money  weight = 0.15
#        A continuous cost-efficiency curve (akin to NEDA's ICER concept in
#        A4.3.4/A4.4.1) peaking around PhP 1M, the typical scale at which an
#        LGU procurement item is both substantial and readily executable
#        within a single fiscal year.
#
#   C4 - Urgency / Gap-Filling              weight = 0.10
#        Keyword-driven classification of the procurement item itself,
#        following Chapter 2's emphasis on addressing identified service
#        gaps: disaster/emergency response ranks highest, followed by
#        infrastructure construction/rehabilitation, direct medical service
#        delivery, livelihood programs, equipment, training, and finally
#        administrative/ceremonial items (food, supplies for meetings).

# Chapter 3 (Data Generation/Gathering Procedure, steps 5-6) requires the
# system to execute "exactly 30 independent runs for each algorithm" on BOTH
# the Pasig (small) and Quezon City (large) datasets, then "compile the
# average optimality parameters" (step 8).
#
# History is therefore keyed by (dataset, algorithm) rather than being one
# flat list, so each of the four combinations required by the experiment
# paper templates keeps its own independent rolling window of 30 trials:
#
#     pasig|bnb   pasig|ga   qc|bnb   qc|ga     (+ dp, kept as a baseline)
#
# A deque with maxlen=30 discards the oldest trial automatically, so the log
# always holds exactly "the last 30 runs" per combination with no manual
# pruning. This is in-memory only: restarting the server clears it, so export
# before shutting the tool down.

    The obvious way to "run both at the same time" is a thread per algorithm.
    That would be wrong here. CPython holds a global interpreter lock, so two
    CPU-bound knapsack solvers in threads do not run simultaneously - they
    take turns, competing for the same core, and each one's measured runtime
    is inflated by however long the other held the lock. Runtime and execution
    time are precisely what the study's paired t-test compares, so contaminated
    timings would invalidate the results.

    Instead the loop interleaves by trial: trial 1 of every algorithm, then
    trial 2, and so on. Only one algorithm computes at any instant, so each
    measurement is as clean as the sequential path, while every algorithm's
    progress advances together in real time. Each algorithm's result is
    emitted the moment it finishes its own final trial, so a faster algorithm
    reports without waiting for a slower one.

# Post-allocation verification and comparative review
#
# Implements step 7 of the Data Generation/Gathering Procedure. The manuscript
# specifies a MANUAL verification phase, so this module does not replace that
# judgement - it supplies the material the reviewer works from:
#
#   1. Automated integrity checks over EVERY selected project (traceability to
#      the source plan, budget compliance, arithmetic consistency). These are
#      mechanical facts a script can establish.
#   2. Sector alignment: each sector's share of the published plan against its
#      share of the funded set, which is the evidence for whether the
#      allocation reflects the LGU's own priorities.
#   3. Comparative review of the two cities, for the scaling question.
#   4. The manual judgement itself is recorded in the exported workbook: the
#      funded-project sheets carry Reviewer verdict and Reviewer note columns,
#      so the reviewer works over the complete allocation in Excel with
#      filtering and sorting rather than over a sample in the browser.
#
# The distinction matters: a script can verify that a project exists in the
# source plan; only a reviewer can judge whether the allocation "aligns with
# realistic public policy demands."
